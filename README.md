<h1>To-Do List App</h1>

The first project that I've undertaken using jQuery.

Type into the 'Add New Task' field to add a new To-Do to the list.
Click on a To-Do to mark it as complete with a line-through.
Hover mouse on the left-hand side of the To-Do to show the delete button, which as expected deletes the selected To-Do!
