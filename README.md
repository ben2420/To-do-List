<h1>To-Do List App</h1>

The first project that I've undertaken using jQuery.

<p>Type into the 'Add New Task' field to add a new To-Do to the list.</p>
<p>Click on a To-Do to mark it as complete with a line-through.</p>
<p>Hover mouse on the left-hand side of the To-Do to show the delete button, which as expected deletes the selected To-Do!</p>
